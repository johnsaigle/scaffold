### Principles

- **Trust the reader** to connect ideas without over-explaining

### Style

- Make prose elegant and fluent
- Favour concision so long as the prose remains vibrant
- **Maintain clear, high-energy prose** with grounded but alive tone - avoid manifesto or personal voice shifts
- Ensure analogies and imagery and fresh and clarifying
- Favour colour and risk over safety

### Revision
- Ensure no mixed metaphors
- Vague business speak or low-effort listicle language is forbidden

### Eliminate all LLM writing crutches and cliches
- emdashes
- bolded text
- "It's not X -- it's Y" constructions
- ending pieces with "The Bottom Line" or obvious summaries
- obvious alliteration
